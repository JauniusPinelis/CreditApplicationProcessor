# CreditApplicationProcessor

## Requirements

.NET 5 installed

## To Run

There are no installable dependencies needed for the projects (apart from .NET 5) 

1. Open cmd in project directory
2. Enter 'dotnet run'

Alternative: you could just click 'start' in Visual Studio

## Things to improve

1. Move RuleConfigurations from .cs to apsettings.json
2. RuleService.cs InterestRate and Decision calculations could moved to a single generic method but i kept them separate. More complex and discussable.
